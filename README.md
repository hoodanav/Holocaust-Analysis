# Holocaust Analysis 
This project reflects on the data about the ethnic orgins of the holocaust victims at Auschwitz concentration camp. The statistics 
related to their mortality and ethnic orgins are discussed, and visualized through `shiny`. Overall, the implications of such and the need to recognize real statistics with sensitivity and historical context in a modern data driven world are discussed.
